On black Friday, every big corporation and small business will promote their products and services using promotional sales. At the same time, every household will have a long shopping list on that day to stack their inventories for the whole year. In order to find the best gifts for families and friends and also to find the best deal, people rely heavily on the company images and promotions they would see during black Friday. Therefore, the marketing strategies companies choose and the segments they intend to target at are especially crucial. Our team chose the dataset of 550,000 observations about the black Friday as our team project because we found the concept of black Friday interesting and that it is highly related to the marketing strategies each business decides to choose.
